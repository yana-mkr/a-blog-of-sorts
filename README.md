This is a CMS-style blog site where you can publish articles, blog posts, thoughts, and opinions.

When entering to the website, the user is presented with a "login" option. Moving to the login page will allow the user to create a new user, or to log in with an existing user. 

The navigation bar includes a home, dashboard and log in or log out button based on the user status.

The user is able to create their own posts from the dashboard and view, comment on, edit, and delete those posts as well. From the homepage, the user can see posts of other individuals and comment on them.

There is a log out button to end the session.
